RESURRECTION
============
This project was started back in 2009
as a university project. It was never
finished. As of 2012, I decided to publish
the source code and finish this game.
There are _many_ things to be done, audio,
a decent gameplay, a real menu, _lots_ of
code optmization, and so on. In other other,
this game is work in progress. There is a new
roadmap in the works, which will be published
soon.

A NOTE ON THE FONTS USED
========================

The source file of the font we use
in the game (N-Gage) can be found
in util/fontdump.

We have written a small program
called dumpfont, also located in util/fontdump
which extracts glyphs from true type fonts
into png files. For further information,
refer to dumpfont's usage at the command
prompt


MISSING FEATURES
================

There is a TODO list in this directory.
Unfortunately, we did not have time to
implement a decent background, a truly
useful menu, or a Game Over screen.
This game might have its development
resumed, and eventually these will be
implemented.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

First, configure and generate Makefiles:

$ ./configure --prefix=<INSTALL_PATH>

then make it:

$ make

and finally install it

$ make install

Build dependencies: libsdl, libgl (or mesagl), libglu and libpng.
(configure script should warn you if any of these are missing)

In order to run the game:

$ cd <INSTALL_PATH>/starone
$ ./starone

Enjoy :)
