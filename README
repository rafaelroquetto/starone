A NOTE ON THE PUBLIC API
========================

Even though this game has not been
written in a object oriented language
(we should've gone for C++, but it was too
late when we realized that), we tried to
stick as much as possible with encapsulation
standards.
We have achieved that by publishing
the objects public APIs at their
respective header files, with proper
documentation.

All functions internal to a single 
module, i.e., which are not supposed
to be accessed outside the module boundaries
have been marked as 'static', thus explicitly
forcing module encapsulation and
orthogonality. For instance,
in order to prevent a ship
from firing beams continously,
the ship implementation relies
on an internal function, whose
prototype follows:

static int
ship_can_fire(const struct ship *s);

This is  function is never accessed
by outsiders, for it relies on internal
module logic, and is indirectly used by
ship_fire_front() function, part of the
public API.

Please bear in mind we do not mean to
implement OO features such as inheritance
and polymorphism, because it would have
made sense to port everything to C++.
However, we do want to highlight we
tried to keep things as modular as possible,
as long as they didn't compel us to do black
magic (and obfuscating the code).

A NOTE ON THE FONTS USED
========================

The source file of the font we use
in the game (N-Gage) can be found
in util/fontdump.

We have written a small program
called dumpfont, also located in util/fontdump
which extracts glyphs from true type fonts
into png files. For further information,
refer to dumpfont's usage at the command
prompt


MISSING FEATURES
================

There is a TODO list in this directory.
Unfortunately, we did not have time to
implement a decent background, a truly
useful menu, or a Game Over screen.
This game might have its development
resumed, and eventually these will be
implemented.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

First, configure and generate Makefiles:

$ ./configure --prefix=<INSTALL_PATH>

then make it:

$ make

and finally install it

$ make install

Build dependencies: libsdl, libgl (or mesagl), libglu and libpng.
(configure script should warn you if any of these are missing)

In order to run the game:

$ cd <INSTALL_PATH>/starone
$ ./starone

Enjoy :)
