MILESTONE 1:
- Tweak respawn_asteroid() <- seems like spawns are occuring more frequently at the top left corner
- Do not allow asteroids to overlap
- Reimplement scheisse asteroid_collide() function (current one is just a placeholder)
- Move general collision code to a separate file, i.e., outside of main.c
- Add another spaceship
- Figure out how to remove list warnings such as " main.c: In function ‘free_explosions’:
main.c:447: warning: passing argument 2 of ‘list_free’ from incompatible pointer type"
- Documentation

MILESTONE 2:
- Fix particle_fade_to_color() -> add dynamic color fade factor calculation 
- Add initial explosion circle, make explosion more attractive
- Use VertexBuffer for explosion
- Dynamic background
- http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_vertexarray.html (vertexbuffer)

LATER TASKS:
- Find and fix memory leaks
- Use vectors instead of angles
- Finish pulse implementation
- Add white circle to explosion
- Add white circle to pulse
- Check pulse collisions
- More fancy asteroids
- Menus
- Sound effects
